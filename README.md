# SPARKLE
This repository containts the information about the SPARKLE framework.

<b> Generated Results</b>
SolvationEnergy and SpecificEnergy folders have the information about the SISSO input file, the data files used to build the model and also the output files generated.

<Results Replication</b>

To replicate the results we got, plese look into the folder named <b>code</b> which have information about the uni-variate feature with SISSO to reduce the feature dimensionality and generate the required datasets for training the final model. 

<b> Used Dependencies</b>
1. Mordred Descriptors (https://github.com/mordred-descriptor/mordred) : Python package for calculating molecular descriptors which can be installed using <b> pip install mordred</b> 
2. SISSO (https://github.com/rouyang2017/SISSO): Program used for building the models. Fortran implemented package (may have some difficulties in setting the environment.)
