This folder contains the code reproducing SPARKLE’s results in “Efficient discovery of high-performance organic electrode materials using a multi-objective interpretable machine learning framework” 

Running feature_selection.py will perform SIS pre-screening on the molecular descriptor training set, and use the selected features with SISSO to learn a model.  The results generated by running the code with the given datafiles available in the Data.tar.gz can be compared to the train.dat files available in the SpecificEnergy and SolvationEnergy data folders to replicate the results.

The plotting_script.py can be used to visualize  training and testing results on the  specific energy and solvation energy models.
