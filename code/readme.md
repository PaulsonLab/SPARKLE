This folder contains the information about the univariate feature selection with SISSO that is implemented to reduce the initial dimensionality to the top 100 features.. and the datafiles..

<b>Uni-variate feature selection wit SISSO:</b> <br>
With the cosniderations huge dimension of 1000 feature variables and computational constraints, we performed the approach of uni-variate selection with the SISSO method to reduce the dimensionlity to top 100 performing features with metric as RMSE to screen. <br>

Please compare the results generated by running the code with the given datafiles available in the (Data.tar.gz) to the train.dat files available in the SpecificEnergy and SolvationEnergy data folders.


plotting_script.py - Python script for generating the plots for the traning and testing of the specific energy and solvation energy with the models generated.
