This folder contains the information about the univariate feature selection with SISSO that is implemented to reduce the initial dimensionality to the top 100 features.. and the datafiles..

<b>Uni-variate feature selection wit SISSO:</b>
With the cosniderations huge dimension of 1000 feature variables and computational constraints, we performed the approach of uni-variate selection with the SISSO method to reduce the dimensionlity to top 100 performing features with metric as RMSE to screen. Then identified features are passed to the SISSO
