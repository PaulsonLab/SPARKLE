This folder contains the code reproducing SPARKLE’s results in “Efficient discovery of high-performance organic electrode materials using a multi-objective interpretable machine learning framework” 

Running <tt>feature_selection.py</tt> will perform SIS pre-screening on the molecular descriptor training set, and use the selected features with SISSO to learn a model.  The results generated by running the code with the given datafiles available in <tt>Data.tar.gz</tt> can be compared to <tt>train.dat</tt> files available in the SpecificEnergy and SolvationEnergy data.

<tt>plotting_script.py</tt> can be used to visualize training and testing results for the learned specific energy and solvation energy models.
